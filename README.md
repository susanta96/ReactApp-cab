## How It Works
To be really specific, Cab Booking Web App where you get a list of cabs with all the details like car model to rate etc.
Now you can click on the particular **BOOK NOW** button. Then you go to a page where You fill up the contact details with date.
And Click on **Confim Booking** button to send the data to server. And Get a mail About Confim Details.
You can also Filter the Cabs using Left Filter Panel.**But This is not Implemented yet. **

## Usage

**Need to have install Latest Node.js in the System** 

Then, Download the `ReactApp-cab`:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/susanta96/ReactApp-cab.git
```

After Cloning the App go the folder :

```sh
$ cd ReactApp-cab
```

Then, type the command in the `terminal`:

```sh
$ npm install
```
this will install all the neccessary packages for the server.
Now type this command in the `terminal`:
```sh
$ npm run client-install
```
Or,
```sh
$cd client
$npm install
```
It will install the packages for client.

Now, for run the `server`:
```sh
$ npm run server
```
And for the `Client`:
```sh
$ npm run client
```
Or,
```sh
$cd client
$npm start
```
**Make sure you use separate terminal for Server & client**

Still, if you wanna run the server & client into the same terminal 
Just type the Command Below:
```sh
$ npm run dev
```
Now you can open the browser and go to :
```http://localhost:3000/```


Happy Coding!)
